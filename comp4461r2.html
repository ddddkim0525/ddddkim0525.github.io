				<h2>COMP4461 Project #2 Group: Augre</h2>
		<h3>Brainstorming</h3>
		<img class = "center" src="comp4461p2/r2p1.PNG" style="width:28em;"><br>
		<p>&emsp; We sat down in the computer barn, each with a google doc open, and talked about areas of paper products we can enhance with AR. This was a long list, and in the end we voted on 3 ideas, so we can split the group in to 2 and each can work on one. During the brainstorming stage, I had the idea of paper lanterns, airport paper tickets, sticky notes, startbucks Cups etc. During the voting process, my criteria was mostly on how simple the idea was for us to create a convincing demo. In the end, maps, menu and instruction manuals were chosen. I worked with Vaishu on Instruction Manuals</p>

		<h3>Designs</h3>

		<p>&emsp;After disscussing with Vaishu, we focused on instruction manuals in furniture like ikea, as most electornic products are designed so that minimal actions were required to start using the product. We set our main user to be adults in theier 20s/30s that started to move into their own house. Instruction manuals are physically 2D, so we thought it would benefit best for an AR approach, as we can add 3D model display on the 2D image. After settling on the basic idea, we formulated the idea of an AR instruction manual, with additional features such as animations on building, and highlighting corresponding parts.</p>
		<h3>AR Menu</h3>

		<p>&emsp; After every mini-group showed their storyboard, we voted on the one idea to start diving deep. In the end, AR Menu was selected. I also voted on it, due to its easier nature on showing on a demo. We split the workload in to three parts: Video, Presentation, and Implementation. Angelica and I were responsible in coding the demo.</p>
		<h3>Implementaion</h3>

		<p>&emsp; I met with Angelica to talk about the detail functions for the demo. We decided on two things to implement: ingredient showing and size comparison. While I created a quick demo with a low poly sushi, Angelica insisted on using a realistic model for the food. In retrospect, I think that was a great decision, as it gave a bit or realism to our demo. I was responsible on displaying the ingredients of the food, which was sushi, my favorite food. When making the ingredients float for the salmon sushi roll ( model downloaded from SketchFab and Poly), I really wanted to add a boid animation where herds of fish would swim around the sushi roll. Thus I found an opensource unity tutorial on animating boids on Unity by Sebatian Lauge <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqtqltqcQhw&t=438s" target="_blank">Tutorial Link</a>. I ported his code to a lower version of Unity where Vuforia engine was supported, and tuned the code and model to suit the application. It was fascinating to see the animation come to life as the sushi was displayed, I was really happy for how things turned out. Later we changed the target marker from plain text on white background to actual menu for a pinch of realism to our demo. </p>
		<h3>Reflection</h3>
		<p>&emsp;There were a few lessons I learnt through this project.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Having interactivity in the product is very important. While the fish animation I coded was nice to look at, it was the button that changed the pizza size that created a more emotional response to the user. I think the layer of interactivity makes people more invested on the demo. </li>
			<li>Polish is what makes the demo look nice, but the core functionality must be implemented first.</li>
			<li>Division of labor was done very well in this project, I think in a small scale prototype like this, having few peopele managing each parts were much more productive due to less time needed to find a common consensus.</li>
